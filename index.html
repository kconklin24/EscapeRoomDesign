<h1>The Search of the Ghost  Light</h1>

 <h3>Leaving a single light burning in an empty theater is an old superstition that is believed to ward off unwanted, haunted spirits in the theater. It is important that this “ghost light” stays on at all times when the theater is dark. However, in this particular theater, the spirits that inhabit it are smarter and more clever than most. Tonight, the janitor that was working the night shift noticed that the ghost light was not lit up on the stage. He decided to investigate further, assuming that all it needed was a slight twist like usual. He pulled out his flashlight and could not believe his tired eyes! The ghost light was completely shattered and shards of glass covered the stage. He immediately ran to the back prop room to find a spare light bulb, but did not see any in the bin where they were usually kept. The ghosts that belong to this theater have created an elaborate hunt to find a new lightbulb, including mind bending activities and stories along the way. Join him on his spooky journey full of puzzles and games in order to replace the ghost light and stop the evil spirits from harming the theater!
